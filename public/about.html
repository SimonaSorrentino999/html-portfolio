<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Currently I'm a master student in Digital humanities. I'm studying digital subjects combined with humanistic subjects. 
I have been graduated in languages but I discovered that languages aren't enough so I discovered my passion for technology.

</p>

<p>During my studies I discovered web development and I become passionate about front-end. This is the reason why I joined the Apple Foundation Program where I strenghten my skills in web design and web development field.</p>
And now I'm pursuing this course where I'm strenghtening my front-end's knowledge.
